# CP-Lab-Project
This is a console-based implementation of the classic Pac-Man game developed using C++. The game features a 20x20 grid-based map populated with walls (#), pellets (.), and two ghosts (G) that chase the player. The player controls Pac-Man (P, changing to <, >, ^, or v based on direction) using the W, A, S, and D keys to move up, left, down, and right respectively. The objective is to collect all pellets without colliding with walls or ghosts. Each collected pellet increases the player's score by 1. If the player touches a ghost or a wall, the game ends. The game dynamically generates the map and includes simple ghost AI with random movement patterns toward the player. Additionally, the game supports score tracking across sessions using a file-based system (score.txt). After each game, the player's score is saved and the highest score is displayed. Players can also choose to view past scores or delete all saved scores. The introduction and instructions are displayed at the start by reading from a file (gameintro.txt). This project demonstrates fundamental file I/O, use of external libraries like <conio.h> for real-time input, and basic game mechanics using arrays and conditionals. It's an educational project suitable for beginners looking to learn C++ through game development. Note: This game is designed for Windows environments due to the use of system("cls") and _getch().
